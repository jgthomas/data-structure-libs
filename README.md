# data-structures-and-algorithms

Exploring data structures, algorithms and C

### algorithms

Generic implementations of a range of search and sort algorithms

### applications

Small programs built around a data structure or algorithm

### data_strucutres

Generic implementations of a range of major data structures

### demos

For algorithms, the demo's output illustrates each step in the sort and how it transforms the data. For data structures, the demos are interactive, allowing an exploration of adding, deleting, searching and other operations

### reference

Simple, annotated versions of each data struture and algorithm aiming to capture their essence

### tests

Unit tests for the generic data structure and algorithm implementations

### tools

Set of utility functions used by the data structure and algorithm code
