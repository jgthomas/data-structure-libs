# data-structures-and-algorithms

Exploring data structures, algorithms, and C

### algorithms

Generic implementations of a range of search and sort algorithms

### applications

Small programs built around a data structure or algorithm

### data_strucutres

Generic implementations of a range of major data structures

### demos

* algorithms

> demo illustrates each step in the sort and how it transforms the data. 

* data structures

> the demos are interactive, allowing an exploration of adding, deleting, searching and other operations

### reference

Simple, annotated versions of each data structure and algorithm aiming to capture their essence

### tests

Unit tests for the generic data structure and algorithm implementations

### tools

Set of utility functions used by the data structure and algorithm code
